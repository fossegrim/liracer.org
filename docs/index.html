      <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
      <h3>Q: Why the name "liracer"?</h3>
      The name "liracer" is a combination of "li", short for libre, and racer. The name is inspired by the free and open source chess platform <a href="https://lichess.org">lichess</a>.
      <h3>Q: Which platforms do liracer support?</h3>
      liracer is developed with Safari and Chrome on MacOS and Linux, but it is intended to work on all modern desktop browsers. liracer does not support mobile browser and adding support for them is not planned either. I might make a TUI(terminal/textual user interface) client at some point though.
      <h3>Q: Which software license does liracer use?</h3>
      liracer is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">AGPL3</a> licensed.
